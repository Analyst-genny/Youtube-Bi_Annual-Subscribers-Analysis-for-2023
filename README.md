•	Least Popular Category: Games is the least subscribed category, suggesting limited engagement from YouTube's broader audience.


From the observation, the following were recommended:
	Given that English and Hindi are the most subscribed languages, creators should prioritize producing content in these languages to tap into the largest audience segments.
	Since entertainment is the top category by subscriber count, creators should invest in more entertainment-related content to attract and engage the largest audience base.
	The growth in YouTube subscribers from El Salvador presents a promising opportunity. Targeted content for this region can help capture new and emerging audiences.
	With games being the least popular category, creators in the gaming niche should consider diversifying their content or integrating elements from more popular categories like entertainment to boost engagement.
	To enhance growth, creators should focus on tailoring content for top subscriber countries like India, the U.S., and South Korea, by incorporating region-specific interests and trends.
YouTube should expand into emerging markets like El Salvador by supporting local content creators and focusing on region-specific trends. To increase engagement in less popular categories like gaming, they could introduce live events and interactive features. Diversifying content in multiple languages, especially for top categories like entertainment and music, can drive global engagement. Additionally, cross-platform collaborations with influencers can accelerate growth across key markets
